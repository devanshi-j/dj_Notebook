3 BASIC FEATURES OF DESKTOP COMPUTING:
1. Computation: CPU, GPU, TPU etc.
                two types of processor:
                 1. CISC processors (AMD, Intel)
                 2. RISC processors (ARM) (FUTURISTIC)
2. Storage: OPERATING SYSTEM (O.S)
                 1. Windows (closed source)
                 2. Linux   (Open source)
                    It has two types of spaces: User space and Kernel space (changes can be made through and in kernel space, follows ISA: instruction set architecture)

SEVERS:
1. DESKTOP COMPUTING:
              offers: upto 8GB, 16GB RAM and is not Sharable.
3. CLOUD COMPUTING: It is sharable
              offers: upto 2TB of RAM storage.

BARE METAL: Servers that have no information stored inside them, in other words FRESH SEVERS.
Dual Boot: Installation of two operating system on the same sevrer (DONE WITH THE HELP OF HYPERVISOR, VMWARE OR VIRTUAL BOX).
HYPERVISOR: type-1 (before installing operating system)
            type-2 (after installing operating system)
