3 BASIC FEATURES OF DESKTOP COMPUTING:
1. Computation: CPU, GPU, TPU etc.
                two types of processor:
                 1. CISC processors (AMD, Intel)
                 2. RISC processors (ARM) (FUTURISTIC)
2. Storage: OPERATING SYSTEM (O.S)
                 1. Windows (closed source)
                 2. Linux   (Open source)
                    It has two types of spaces: User space and Kernel space (changes can be made through and in kernel space, follows ISA: instruction set architecture)
                             2 families of Linux are:
                                       1. DEBIAN: UBUNTU, KALI LINUX etc.
                                       2. RHEL: FELONA, CENTAS, RED HAT etc.
                 3. MACOS   (closed source)
3. Network: Internet (WAN)
                     COMPONENTS:
                     1. IP addess
                     2. DNS servers
                     3. Routing etc.
            Intranet (LAN)

SEVERS:
1. DESKTOP COMPUTING:
              offers: upto 8GB, 16GB RAM and is not Sharable.
3. CLOUD COMPUTING: It is sharable
              offers: upto 2TB of RAM storage.

BARE METAL: Servers that have no information stored inside them, in other words FRESH SEVERS.
Dual Boot: Installation of two operating system on the same sevrer (DONE WITH THE HELP OF HYPERVISOR, VMWARE OR VIRTUAL BOX).
HYPERVISOR: type-1 (before installing operating system)
            type-2 (after installing operating system)


TIM BERNERS LEE: THE DEVELOPER OF WEB


LAYERS: 
there are in total 7 layers:

OSI MODEL
L1: PHYSICAL (cable, connectors etc)
L2: LINKS (mAC addrexx or NIC address, NIC = Network Interface Card)
L3: IP address
L4: Port address

TCP/IP MODEL
L5: Full/half Duplex RCP
L6: Presentation (ACSII)
L7: Application (DNS, https etc)

PORT NUMBER:
FTP: 21 OR 20
SMTP: 25
SSH: 22
TelNet: 23

TLS (Transport Lane Security) = L3 + L4

HTTPS: HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL SECURE SOCKET LAYER

2 types of architecture:
1. VON NUMAN ARCHITECTURE: basic concept states that program should be in the main memory.
2. HARVARD ARCHITECTURE.


CRYPTOGRAPHY: 
1. CLASSICAL CRYPTOGRAPHY
2. POST QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY

GITHUB, Bitcoin, Data Structure uses Merkel tree structure

DATA STRUCTURE:

1. Primitive: int, float, char etc.
2. Non-Primitive:
       1. Linear:
            a. Quene (First in first out)
            b. Array
            c. Stack (Last in first out)
       2. Non-Linear:
            a. Tree
            b. Graph

   FORMATION OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:
   1. SYNTAX: basic structure, differs language to language.
   2. OOPS: Object Oriented Programming Structure
             a. CLASS: Blueprint
             b. OBJECT: Final Structure
             c. REFRENCE: A link to object
             d. CONSTRUCTER: name of constructer = name of class
             e. NEW (Keyword): helps to create space in memory
             f. ENCAPSULATION: Combined forms
             g. ABSTRACTION: To hide
             h. POLYMORPHISM Differention of many forms
             i. INHERITENCE: same thing has different properties
   4. DATA STRUCTURE
   5. FUNCTIONS:
         1. Create a function
         2. Call a function   
   6. LOOPS:
          a. for loop
          b. while loop
   9. CONDITIONS:
          a. if statement
          b. else statement


   VON NUMAN ARCHITECTURE:

    1. IDE (Integreted Development Environment)
         eg: VS Code, Atom etc.
    2. Compiler
    3. Converts code into Assembly Language
    4. Linker (Links Libraries)
    5. Loader (transfers program to main memory)
    6. Optimisation (reduces the file size)
